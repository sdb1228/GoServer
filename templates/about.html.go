			<p>Since he was six years old, Steven Burnett was all about soccer. He played at recess, in his parents' basement during winter, playing Keeper Wars on the trampoline - every chance he could.</br></br>
				“Any ball was treated like a soccer ball,” he said. </br> </br>
				Throughout his soccer career - from competitive leagues to the University of Utah, from AYSO to adult leagues - he experienced the same thing: communication problems. Players would drive to the wrong location, or sometimes they wouldn't even hear about the game at all.</br></br>
				Tired of hunting down information on unreliable websites or waiting for the team captain to text last minute game information, Steven Burnett came up with a plan. In August 2015, armed with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Utah, he created SoccerLC, a free app that gives recreation league players instant and reliable access to their schedules.</br></br>
				“I don't want people to think that just because they're not playing professional soccer they have all these limitations,” he said. “I want something that's not only going to make my life easier, but make everybody's life easier.”</br></br>
				This is just the start for Steven, who would eventually like to add training tools and team tracking abilities to the app. He hopes that easier access to schedules will allow players to spend more time growing as players.</br></br>
				“I want to see more professional athletes come from the youth leagues,” he said. “I want more growth in the United States in soccer and eventually I want us to become the next English Premier League or the next La Liga.”</br></br>
				Steven would like to thank the following people for their contributions:</br></br>
				Calvin Kern, who improved the Android app's functionality and overall speed. The app wouldn't be as stable without his help.</br></br>
				Ryan Norton, who contributed to the Let's Play scraper. Without him we wouldn't have been able to get started on the app so quickly.</br></br>
				Doug Burnett - my father - who kept the server and the resources we needed up and running and saved us a lot of money from parse.</br></br>
				Jessica Burnett – my beautiful wife – who supports me throughout the whole process and gives insight to what app users want and need. Without her, I probably would have given up a long time ago.</br></br>
				Rachel Christensen, who contributed to marketing, design, social media, and branding. Without her we would have just stuck with black and white.</p>
